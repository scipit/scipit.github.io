### Chapter 1: What uncle sam really wants

- a whirlwind-like account of US foreign policy and interventions (post-WWII era); mostly shocking, both on the moral as well as on the political level

- Some notes on the meaning of the terms in political discourse
- dictionary meaning vs. doctrinal meaning (p. 64ff)
- **democracy**
    - a society is democratic to the extent that people can participate in a meaningful way in managing their affairs.
    - Doctrinal meaning: a system in which decisions are made by (political, economical, social) elites and/or by the business community. The general public are "spectators of the action", not participants. Public policy is none of their business.
- **free enterprise**
    - doctrinal meaning: a system of public subsidy and private profit, with massive government intervention in the economy to maintain a welfare state for the rich.
    - Interesting note: "In fact [...], just about any phrase containing the word free is likely to mean the opposite of its actual, literal meaning."
- **socialism**
    - dictionary meaning (arguably): control of production by the workers themselves, not by owners and managers
    - doctrinal meaning: used in practice, referring to the Soviet Union as a socialist state is a case of doctrinal doublespeak as the political leaders of the the Soviet Union were quick in demolishing everything that could have been considered an implementation of socialist ideas
    
- p. 66: "To make sense of political discourse, it's necessary to give a running translation into English, decoding the doublespeak of the media, academic social scientists and the secular priesthood generally. Its function is not obscure: the effect is to make it impossible to find words to talk about matters of human significance in a coherent way. We can then be sure that little will be understood about how our society works and what is happening in the world - a major contribution to 'democracy', in the PC sense of the world."

- p. 71 **what you can do**
    - power is within the hands of those who make the investment decisions; what is produced and what is distributed. This elite wants or needs a passive, quiescent population
    - there are a lot of possibilities to make their life uncomfortable, ranging from just asking the right questions, to demonstrations and writing letters to your state's representatives (as long as you persevere)
